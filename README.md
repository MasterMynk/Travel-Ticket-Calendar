***Script is still a work in progress***

A script that you can use to add your travel ticket as an event to your google calendar

To use the script you need to have `credentials.json` file in the same folder as the script.
This file can be obtained by following the steps mentioned [here](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/quickstart/python) under `Set up your environment`

**DO NOT SHARE YOUR `credentials.json` and the `token.json` file that is generated after running the script for the first time and logging in with anyone**
